# Write a line down here, A couple examples to get you started:
# - 30:MESSAGE:&6Thirty Seconds Left --- Would send a message when there is 30 seconds left
# - 1:COMMAND:hub --- Would execute /hub for every player online 1 second before the restart occurs
# - 3:CONSOLE:save-all --- Would save everything 3 seconds before the restart occurs
